#DESCRIPTION:
This project is a basic E-Learning platform front-end website created to understand how course-based websites guide users through lessons. The goal of this project is to practice page structure, navigation, and small user interactions using only client-side technologies. It does not attempt to build a complete learning management system and therefore does not include accounts, servers, or database storage.

The website contains multiple pages such as Home, Courses, Video Player, and Dashboard. The Home page acts as the starting point and provides navigation links to other sections. The Courses page displays available lessons using simple cards so a user can select a topic easily. When a lesson is opened, the Video Player page shows an embedded learning video along with its title and basic information.

To simulate learning progress, a small completion tracking feature is included. When the user clicks the mark complete button, the progress percentage increases. The value is saved in browser local storage so refreshing the page does not remove the progress. This storage exists only on that device and works as a demonstration of remembering user activity without using login systems.

The interface is intentionally simple and readable. Clear buttons, balanced spacing, and minimal colors help the user focus on content instead of design effects. The layout adjusts automatically on different screen sizes so the website works properly on both mobile phones and desktop computers.

During development, I practiced connecting multiple pages, updating elements using JavaScript, and storing small data in the browser. The project helped in understanding how educational interfaces move users step by step through lessons even with basic functionality.

Overall, this project represents a beginner-level learning website that demonstrates course viewing and progress indication using only front-end technologies.
